        Initializes the Survey environment with the specified configuration.

        Parameters:
            num_obstacles (int): The number of obstacles to be placed in the environment. These obstacles obstruct the agents' paths and limit their ability to navigate and view grid squares.
            num_agents (int): The number of agents to be included in the environment. Each agent can interact with the environment.
            vision_dist (float): The maximum distance at which an agent can perceive its surroundings. This affects the length of the 'red line' in the rendered simulation.
            grid_resolution (int): The resolution of the grid used to represent the environment. A higher resolution means a finer grid with more cells.
            grid_max_reward (float): The maximum reward value that a grid cell can have. This value is used to initialize the reward distribution in the environment, and to cap reward from increasing indefinitely.
            reward_delta (float): The amount by which the reward of a grid cell increases after each time step. This can be used to control the frequency with which an optimal policy would dictate than an agent should re-visit a grid square.
            observation_mode (str): The mode of observation for the agents. This can determine how agents perceive their environment, e.g., as raw pixel values ("image") or as processed features ("dense").

        Returns:
            None
